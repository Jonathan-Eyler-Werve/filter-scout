Feature roadmap:

- As a browsing user, I can see why a thing was muted so that I can understand my current rules.

  - Inside tweet review loop, when trigger fires, stash tweet content and filter content.
  - Append a notification wrap. It is styled to display over the tweet. It includes the rule.
  - On click, notification wrap hides.

- As a setup user, I can establish new filter words so that they never appear in my feed.
- As a setup upser, I can set block rules (hide, wrap, mute, allow) for different types of content.
- As a browsing user, I can opt-in to report my rules and what triggers them back to a central repository.
